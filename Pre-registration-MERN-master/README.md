# Pre-registration system

 System for online course registration. The main features are: 
 - adding courses 
 - view your curriculum and course details, 
 - timetable, 
 - admin panel and user panel, 
 - course and user info for admins, 
 - easy addition and removal of courses.
 
## Tecnology and code

The whole system is made using the MERN stack. This is the first time I used MERN and there are a lot of things which could be improved.
The whole front-end is located in src folder (react,js,css,html) and backed in backend folder(node,mongo).
